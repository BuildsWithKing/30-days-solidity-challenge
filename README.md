# 🔥 30-Day Solidity Mastery Challenge

### 🚀 One Smart Contract or Dev Task Every Day – From Zero to Smart Contract Hero

This repository contains my daily smart contract builds and development tasks as part of my 30-day Solidity mastery challenge.  
The goal is to master core Solidity concepts — including structs, mappings, modifiers, custom errors, access control, testing, and deployment — by building real-world smart contracts *and* leveling up with *Foundry testing and scripting*.
