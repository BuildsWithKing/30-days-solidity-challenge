# 🔥 30-Day Solidity Mastery Challenge

### 🚀 One Smart Contract or Dev Task Every Day – From Zero to Smart Contract Hero

This repository contains my daily smart contract builds and development tasks as part of my 30-day Solidity mastery challenge.  
The goal is to master core Solidity concepts — including structs, mappings, modifiers, custom errors, access control, testing, and deployment — by building real-world smart contracts *and* leveling up with *Foundry testing and scripting*.

### 🧠 Why This Matters

This challenge is more than just code.  
It’s about consistency, clarity, and building real-world experience in the Web3 space.

I'm not just building smart contracts —  
I'm building **a dev portfolio**, **a teaching asset**, and **a life of purpose**. ⚡
