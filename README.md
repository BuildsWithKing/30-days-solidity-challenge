# 🔥 30 Days Solidity Challenge

### 🚀 One Smart Contract Every Day – From Zero to Smart Contract Hero

This repository contains my daily smart contract projects as part of my *30-days Solidity coding challenge*.  
The goal is to *master core Solidity concepts* — including structs, mappings, modifiers, custom errors, access control, and more — by building real smart contracts from scratch *every single day*.
