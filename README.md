# 🔥 30 Days Solidity Challenge

## One Smart Contract Every Day – From Zero to Smart Contract Hero

## This repository contains my daily smart contract projects as part of a 30-day Solidity coding challenge. The goal is to master core Solidity concepts—including structs, mappings, modifiers, custom errors, access control, and more—by building real smart contracts from scratch every single day.

Each folder represents a new day, a new challenge, and a new learning milestone. 💪
Follow along as I grow into a solid Web3 backend (smart contract) developer.
